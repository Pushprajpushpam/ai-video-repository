Project Title: AI-Powered Video Creation Automation

Overview:

This project automates the creation of short educational or promotional videos using artificial intelligence. The system converts input text or topics into fully edited videos with AI-generated voiceovers, background music, images, and animations using Python and OpenAI tools.


---

Objectives:

Automate the video creation process.

Generate text scripts using AI (e.g., GPT-4).

Convert text to voice using text-to-speech APIs.

Match visuals (images, icons, short clips) using search or stock resources.

Combine all elements into a polished video using video editing libraries or tools.



---

Tech Stack:

Python (core programming language)

OpenAI GPT API (for script generation)

Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) or ElevenLabs API (for AI voiceover)

Pexels API / Unsplash API (for free stock images/videos)

MoviePy or FFmpeg (for video editing/compilation)



---

Workflow:

1. Input: User provides a topic (e.g., “Solar Energy”).


2. Script Generation: Use OpenAI’s API to create a brief, engaging video script.


3. Voiceover: Convert the script into an AI-generated voice.


4. Visuals Matching: Automatically fetch images or short video clips that match each line or scene of the script.


5. Video Compilation: Merge voiceover, visuals, transitions, and background music.


6. Output: Final MP4 video file, ready to be uploaded or shared.
